This project is intended as an extension of the [*Project Chrono*](https://projectchrono.org/) multi-physics simulation engine 
for simulating biomechanical systems and exoskeletons. For now, the main focus is on the simulation of the 
human jaw, which is supposed to provide the basis for developing a jaw exoskeleton for treating temporomandibular
disorders (TMDs) in the future.

By abstracting the model parameters and components to *JSON* files, the simulation can be more easily configured, 
extended, and adapted to different individuals and applications.

## Installation
Installation instructions can be found in the [scripts/install/README.md](scripts/install/README.md) file. 
Different installation methods are provided, including a script to install the dependencies and the project from source
automatically. The script is only intended for Ubuntu, but it should work on other Linux distributions and Windows or
macOS with a few modifications as well.

## Features
- **Biomechanical Jaw Simulation**: Three jaw model variants are available depending on the intended use case:
  - A basic rigid body model with the TMJs constrained by point-on-surface constraints -> useful for general motion
    analysis, kinematics, and rapid prototyping of jaw exoskeletons
  - A basic rigid body model with the TMJs constrained by the natural bone meshes -> useful for simulating the jaw
    with a more realistic contact model and getting rough estimates of the forces acting on the TMJs 
  - A more complex, hybrid model combining rigid body and finite element models (the articular disc is modeled with FEM)
    -> useful for simulating the jaw with more realistic articular discs and getting more accurate estimates of the 
    forces acting on and inside the TMJs (although with a significant time overhead)
- **Configurable Simulation**: The simulation can be configured using *JSON* files, which allows for easy adjustments of
  the model parameters and components. This makes it easier to adapt the simulation to different individuals and 
  applications with less programming effort.

## Usage
For now, there are only three jaw model variants available, which can be used to simulate the jaw with different levels 
of complexity.

The parameters of the jaw simulation can be adjusted conveniently in the configuration JSON files located in the 
[resources/json](/resources/json) directory. A simple example can be found in the 
[jaw_model.cpp](/src/apps/jaw_model.cpp) file, which can be started by running the executable *jaw_model* after 
building the project.

There are four JSON files that can be used to configure the simulation:
- [jaw.json](/resources/json/jaw.json): Contains the general parameters for the jaw simulation.
- [muscles.json](/resources/json/muscles.json): Contains the parameters for the muscles.
- [ligaments.json](/resources/json/ligaments.json): Contains the parameters for the ligaments.
- [fea.json](/resources/json/fea.json): Contains the parameters for the finite element articular disc.

A description and explanation of the simulation configuration can be found in the 
[resources/json/README.md](resources/json/README.md) file.
